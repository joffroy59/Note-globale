## Understand your network with a network mapping tool:

### Get a complete, customizable map of your network.

Spiceworks displays an interactive free network diagram of how your devices relate to each other (layer-3 routers supported). You can manually add, edit, move and resize devices to exactly reflect your network, and even choose filters and views to display the device details you care most about in your network map!

### See bandwidth usage between nodes.

Wondering which device (or user) is hogging most of your bandwidth? Just follow the lines – the thicker the line you see in your network map, the more the bandwidth being used. Or just click the lines to see a detailed graph of bandwidth usage over time.

### Graphically monitor your ink and toner.

You don’t want low levels of ink or toner to sneak up on you. With the Spiceworks Dashboard Ink & Toner widget, you can get a quick look at the ink or toner levels in your printers. You can also use this widget to view your ink and toner consumption history to see any trends, so you know when to stock up. Toner suddenly “disappear”? Track down the guilty party with Spiceworks’ Network Mapping.
