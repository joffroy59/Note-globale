# Accelerate Your Delivery

##### Manage an infrastructure cluster as a single system to simplify container operations.

### [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/docs/whatisk8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, operations, and scaling of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon [a decade and a half of experience of running production workloads at Google](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

#### Planet Scale

Designed on the same principles that allows Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your ops team.

#### Never Outgrow

Whether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.

#### Run Anywhere

Kubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premise, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.

	

## A technical overview
of Kubernetes

Brendan Burns, Software Engineer and a founder of Kubernetes at Google, gives a technical overview of Kubernetes in this 30-minute presentation from CoreOS Fest.

	

### Kubernetes Features

#### Automatic binpacking

Automatically places containers based on their resource requirements and other constraints, while not sacrificing availability. Mix critical and best-effort workloads in order to drive up utilization and save even more resources.

#### Self-healing

Restarts containers that fail, replaces and reschedules containers when nodes die, kills containers that don’t respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn’t advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.

#### Horizontal scaling

Scale your application up and down with a simple command, with a UI, or automatically based on CPU usage.

#### Service discovery and load balancing

No need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives containers their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of containers, and can load-balance across them.

#### Automated rollouts and rollbacks

Kubernetes progressively rolls out changes to your application or its configuration, while monitoring application health to ensure it doesn’t kill all your instances at the same time. If something goes wrong, Kubernetes will rollback the change for you. Take advantage of a growing ecosystem of deployment solutions.

#### Secret and configuration management

Deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your image and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration.

#### Storage orchestration

Automatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, a public cloud provider such as [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) or [AWS](http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Storage_Options.pdf), or a network storage system such as NFS, iSCSI, Gluster, Ceph, Cinder, or Flocker.

#### Batch execution

In addition to services, Kubernetes can manage your batch and CI workloads, replacing containers that fail, if desired.
