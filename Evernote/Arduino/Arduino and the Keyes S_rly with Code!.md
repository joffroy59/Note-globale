# [Arduino and the Keyes S_rly with Code!](http://12vsupport.blogspot.com/2013/10/arduino-and-keyes-srly-with-code.html)

[![[./_resources/Arduino_and_the_Keyes_S_rly_with_Code!.resources/sku_247020_1.jpg]]](http://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_247020_1.jpg)
So I recently bought this amazing "Learn to RFID and Everything Else" kit from Deal Extreme for my Arduino since I wanted to learn more behind some of the technology that goes into the vehicles I work with.
[Arduino Learning Kit](http://dx.com/p/rfid-stepper-motor-learning-kit-for-arduino-multicolored-247020)
Needless to say there is a myriad of sensors and other great accessories in the kit and I set about trying to see what others had done with the RFID reader and what I could do.  After adding a couple things to the RFID reader I decided it would be time to maybe throw a relay into the mix and see what kind of annoying projects I could come up with.
Here's an image of the relay itself, and based on its identifiers, this puppy is good for 10 amps, 30 volts DC and requires 5 volts to trigger (handy!)  There's an LED to indicate if it is on or not, and a spike suppression diode to protect your trigger output from the voltage spike generated when the field collapses keeping the coils energized.
[![[./_resources/Arduino_and_the_Keyes_S_rly_with_Code!.resources/489181929_024.jpg]]](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/929/181/489/489181929_024.jpg)

So now that I had the relay it was time to wire it up!  Not alot of info on the web here but it's _somewhat self explanatory._  First we need to deal with the **input** to the relay, what will make it trigger?  We can see in the picture there is a '+' for positive 5V, a '-' for Ground, and 'S" for Signal.  When it comes to wiring up the device **alot** of people did not support wiring this straight to the Ardy, they recommended using a transistor.  I decided that I was going to be a bad ass and skipped that.  So, how did I wire it?

The '+' was connected to the 5V output terminal on my Leo, the '-' was connected GND output terminal on the LEO, and the 'S' needed to be connected to a pin with PWM output (that's any pin with ~ marked beside it on the board).  I chose pin 9 for the Leo.

**Why does it need to be a PWM pin, why not a digital one?**
You need to use a PWM pin because in order for the relay to trigger, we need to send voltage, 5V to be exact and if we set our PWM to output to its maximum duty cycle, 255, we can get our relay to trigger.

Ok!  So how can we get some simple code to turn on our relay?  Let's get into it!
[![[./_resources/Arduino_and_the_Keyes_S_rly_with_Code!.resources/Relay-Sketch.png]]](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F4ozAa7YTLI/UlyyxpXp1II/AAAAAAAACwQ/YN-x38mYURY/s1600/Relay+Sketch.png)

Now this is very simple, all we're doing is turning on a relay indefinitely, but it gets alot more fun when we add it into larger sketches where its actions are controlled within bigger bodies of code.

[![[./_resources/Arduino_and_the_Keyes_S_rly_with_Code!.resources/RFID-Pic.png]]](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sjfQynsCi0Q/UlyzhQ22ePI/AAAAAAAACwY/MjHwdR4CwR0/s1600/RFID+Pic.png)

In this sketch when my RFID reader successfully authenticates an RFID, it buzzes a piezo, flashes a certain color led, and activates the relay for 5 seconds!  Neat!

After that I had to add three wires into the set screws for the Normally Open (NO), Normally Closed (NC), and Common (unmarked). Onto the common line I inserted a 7.5 amp fuse, but this can be whatever value you like, not to exceed 10 amps, for your project.
