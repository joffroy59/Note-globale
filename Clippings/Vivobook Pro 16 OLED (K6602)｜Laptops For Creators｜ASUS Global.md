### It’s cool to go fast

There’s often nothing casual about being a ‘casual’ creator, with demanding schedules and tight deadlines, even if they are self-imposed! So it’s vital that your laptop can handle anything you throw at it without a fuss. Great cooling is essential for maximum performance, and the ASUS IceCool Plus thermal technology in Vivobook Pro 16 OLED uses upgraded 8 mm and 6 mm heat pipes, dual fans and three exhaust vents that efficiently accelerate heat transfer. The 86-blade fan and impeller are made of tough and light side-chain liquid crystal epoxy polymer (LCP). With less vibration, the Intel Core CPU and NVIDIA GPU can run comfortably at up to a blistering 90 W combined TDP in Performance mode. That’s a very long-winded way to say you can always depend on Vivobook Pro 16 OLED to deliver the best performance!

## MOTION CLARITY

### Ultimate 120 Hz / 0.2 ms for exceptional motion clarity

The new premium ASUS OLED display with 120 Hz refresh rate and 0.2 ms pixel response time is incredibly smooth and clear. In fact, both surprisingly and counter-intuitively, the 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display is faster than a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD IPS display — because it reduces ghosting to an indiscernible level. Simply put, this means even fast-moving visuals are smoother and clearer than ever.

## MOTION CLARITY

### How 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display has better motion clarity than 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display

It seems counter-intuitive that a 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display could outperform a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display rival — so how is this possible? Well, the LCD panel takes precisely 6.06 ms to refresh each frame, but it takes another 3 ms of response time to process the correct colors. That’s a total of 9.06 ms to fully load the image. A 144 Hz / 12.5 ms LCD display takes even longer, at 19.44 ms to show the full, final frame of each image. But with its extreme-speed response, a 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display takes just 8.5 ms to process the same — making it even faster than a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display.

## ASUS SPLENDID TECHNOLOGY

### Customizable color gamut for every need

The display’s color gamut can be quickly and easily switched for different tasks or preferences. On top of the ultravivid native color setting, choose sRGB for creating web content or browsing, DCI-P3 for cinema content, or Display P3 for movie-grade colors finessed to fit everyday viewing in the real world.
