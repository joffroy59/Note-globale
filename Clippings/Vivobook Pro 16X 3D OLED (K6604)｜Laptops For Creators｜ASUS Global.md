## ASUS SPATIAL VISION TECHNOLOGY

### Let your creativity shine in 3D

ASUS Spatial Vision technology offers new and enhanced experiences for creativity, entertainment and more — such as visualization, 3D design, video streaming and gaming. It also offers great potential for rapidly-growing metaverse applications.

## ASUS SPATIAL VISION TECHNOLOGY

### Make magic happen, in comfort!

The eye-tracking system in ASUS Spatial Vision technology uses dual cameras to precisely and dynamically follow the movement of each of your eyes. Apps can then perform real-time rendering and weaving to build a cohesive 3D image that adjusts as you change your viewing position. The OLED display has a special lenticular lens array that delivers separate images to your left and right eyes, so you can see stereoscopic 3D with your naked eyes — no need for cumbersome glasses!

## THERMAL

### IceCool technology for an ultracool laptop

Creating without disturbances is essential for content creation. Keeping all these powerful components quiet requires a solid cooling system. Vivobook Pro 16X 3D OLED features ASUS IceCool Pro thermal technology, ensuring that both the Intel Core CPU and NVIDIA GPU run comfortably at their combined 150 W thermal design power in Performance mode. To achieve this, the dual 83-blade liquid-crystal epoxy-polymer fan blades are just 0.15 mm thin, increasing airflow by up to 6%<sup class="footnote-num"><a href="https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-creators/vivobook/vivobook-pro-16x-3d-oled-k6604/#footnote-18" aria-label="Footnote 18">18</a></sup> than the previous generation. We’ve also introduced a new dual cooling fin design to increase heat transfer. This design provides a larger cooling area, ensuring more heat is transferred effortlessly from heat pipes to fins. The fins have a shark fin-inspired design, increasing the turbulence of the air in the heating layer to ensure efficient heat exhaust. In addition, Vivobook Pro 16X 3D OLED features three fan modes, easily switched in MyASUS, empowering you to choose the balance between acoustics and performance.
