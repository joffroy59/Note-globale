## MOBILITY

### The laptop that moves with you!

Topping the scales at a mere 1 kg, you can see we’ve made an extra effort to make Zenbook S 13 OLED the perfect size for your on-the-move lifestyle. To keep it compact, we use CNC machining to make the most efficient use of the available space for components. Its side profile measures just 1 cm — that’s about as slim as a pen!

## Design

### Elegant colors

It comes in two gorgeous colors: the brand-new Basalt Gray and the classic Ponder Blue. Basalt Gray is inspired by the natural beauty of stone formations. Ponder Blue is a darker color scheme inspired by silent nights spent alone.

![Two Zenbook S 13 OLED, one in Basalt Gray and the other in Ponder Blue, stand on their hinge on matching colored boards.](https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-13-oled-ux5304/)

### Contemporary silhouette

Minimalist style is an important part of the Zenbook design language, with clean lines and a svelte silhouette that turn heads. It's an ultraportable that reflects the pure design philosophy of modern minimalism.

## PLASMA CERAMIC ALUMINUM

### Pioneering sustainability

For the first time, we used a special process to transform the aluminum lid into a plasma ceramic aluminum exclusive to ASUS. This process uses pure water, and no organic compounds, strong acids, or heavy metals are required. Instead, this environmentally low-impact bath-based method produces a physical and chemical transformation of the aluminum. This results in increased wear resistance, corrosion protection, thermal management, hardness<sup class="footnote-num"><a href="https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-13-oled-ux5304/#footnote-6" aria-label="Footnote 6">6</a></sup>, and lifespan.

![](https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-13-oled-ux5304/)

### “It feels like nothing else. It always looks like new.”

The color, shades, porosity, and texture are further fine-tuned using temperature and electricity. Incredibly, this makes each lid individually unique. No two are alike! And even better, the alloy will ensure that the laptop’s unique look will last for its entire lifetime.

### “Minimum eco impact, maximum practicality”

Plasma ceramic aluminum components are also fully recyclable at the end of their life span. The resulting corrosion protection is imparted by changes to the substrate itself, rather than by adding sprayed-on coatings that may be difficult to recycle.

## Environment

### 50%+ lower carbon footprint<sup class="footnote-num"><a href="https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-13-oled-ux5304/#footnote-7" aria-label="Footnote 7">7</a>,<a href="https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-13-oled-ux5304/#footnote-8" aria-label="Footnote 8">8</a></sup>

Natural elements have long inspired the design and craftsmanship of the Zenbook series. To do our part to protect the fundamental sources of our inspiration, ASUS is committed to do more with less through Zenbook. We try to mitigate its carbon footprint by incorporating recycled materials and designing more eco-conscious packaging. In addition, Zenbook S 13 OLED exceeds the ENERGY STAR<sup role="img" aria-label="registered" class="sign-cr">®</sup> energy efficiency standard by 60% to reduce its electricity consumption. Via these sustainable actions, the overarching goal of this device’s sustainability initiatives is to achieve carbon neutrality.
