## DISPLAY

### World-leading 3K ASUS Lumina OLED display

For ultimate visual experience, ASUS Vivobook Pro 15 features the world-leading 16:9 3K OLED HDR NanoEdge screen. With an expansive 16:9 aspect ratio, the display is Dolby Vision certified and PANTONE Validated to ensure accurate color rendering. With 500 nits peak brightness, it’s also VESA DisplayHDR<sup role="img" aria-label="trademark" class="sign-tm">™</sup> True Black 500 certified for the deepest blacks to give you ultra-realistic detail in even the darkest scenes. Its cinema-grade DCI-P3 color gamut delivers ultra-vivid colors, and the 120 Hz refresh rate and 0.2 ms response time make even the fastest action scenes look super-smooth. To keep your eyes comfortable and safe during the longest viewing sessions, it’s also TÜV Rheinland certified for low blue-light emissions.

\* The visual appearance of OLED displays may change over the product’s lifetime. This is expected behavior that can include image persistence or burn-in, where the display shows a faint remnant of an image even after a new image appears on the screen. This tends to occur only in extreme use cases, such as when a static, high-contrast image is continuously displayed for prolonged periods of time. ASUS laptops with an OLED display minimize this risk by setting Windows’s Dark mode as default, as well as shortening the idle time before the screen is turned off — both on mains (AC) and battery (DC) power. This dual approach minimizes the potential for burn-in to maximize the lifespan of your OLED display lifespan, and also reduces unnecessary power draw for optimal battery life. We also recommended adjust the brightness of your OLED display to complement the ambient lighting in your environment, rather than keeping the screen at maximum brightness at all times. You should also ensure that you have an animated, dark-background screensaver enabled in the Windows Settings tool.
