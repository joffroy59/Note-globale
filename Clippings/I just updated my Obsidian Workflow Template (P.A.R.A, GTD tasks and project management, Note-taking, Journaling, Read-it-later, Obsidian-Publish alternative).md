## Introduction

Hi everyone.

In 2023, I shared my [obsidian-workflow-template](https://github.com/mathisgauthey/obsidian-workflow-template) on Github.

The "documentation" was some mere blog posts on my website :

- [My Complete Obsidian Workflow to Manage My Life](https://mathisgauthey.github.io/my-complete-obsidian-workflow-to-manage-my-life/)
- [Obsidian Publish Alternative, How to One-Click Upload Your Notes on Your Own Website](https://mathisgauthey.github.io/obsidian-publish-alternative-how-to-one-click-upload-your-notes-on-your-own-website/)
- [Why Using Obsidian for Life Management](https://mathisgauthey.github.io/why-using-obsidian-for-life-management/)

## What's New

I just wanted to let you know that I just released an **updated version** of the workflow based on my experience in the past few months.

It has now it's own [documentation](https://mathisgauthey.github.io/obsidian-workflow-template-docs/).

You can see most of the changes in details in the [release page](https://github.com/mathisgauthey/obsidian-workflow-template/releases). I did not get everything in the text as there was a lot of small plugin config tweaks, but any major part should be here.

## Features

If you want to try it, here's the core features :

- üé® Beautiful design using [AnuPpuccin: Personal theme for Obsidian](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/anuppuccin).
- üóÉÔ∏è [P.A.R.A](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)\[<sup>1]</sup> folder organisation based on file actionability.
- ‚úÖ [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)\[<sup>2]</sup> task management on par with a [full Todoist setup](https://todoist.com/fr/productivity-methods/getting-things-done), but with a simple and natural way of **writing tasks alongside notes**. You also get to keep your project tasks, notes and files archives when you finish a project, allowing you to access these informations in the future.
- üìÖ Daily notes for task management, periodic notes for projects management (week, month, quarter and year).
- üìì Journal section for each daily and periodic notes to write about anything that happened during a certain period of time.
- üéÆ Media backlog Kanban board for tracking books, shows, movies or video games backlog, consuming media at the right pace, and archiving what you do. All without proprietary online services that hold you data.
- üîó Read-it-later / bookmark manager with automated markdown conversion for offline storage inside your vault using [Omnivore app](https://omnivore.app/). That means easy search for knowledge inside your vault across sources and personal notes.
- üìù [Zettelkasten note-taking](https://everlaab.com/methode-zettelkasten-comment-prendre-des-notes-utiles/) on a flat structure inside `3-Resources` folder.

1. üìé Import sources automatically using [obsidian-omnivore](https://github.com/omnivore-app/obsidian-omnivore) plugin for an automatic markdown conversion of a webpage or document online or manually from a file or using [markdownload](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload).
2. Highlight and take reference notes using [Omnivore app](https://omnivore.app/) or directly inside your vault using a simple markdown file.
3. Write literature notes to summarise the source informations.
4. Write permanent notes from key concepts directly inside literature notes using wiki-links.
- üåê One click upload of file and attachments to a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) thanks to [obsidian-github-publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher) plugin.

Can you explain how you process items from todoist into the different part of the vault? It doesn't seem you can move or tag those tasks. All you can do is checked in which case it would disappear. A separate question, it seems that once you check the box, it also sync to todoist app?
