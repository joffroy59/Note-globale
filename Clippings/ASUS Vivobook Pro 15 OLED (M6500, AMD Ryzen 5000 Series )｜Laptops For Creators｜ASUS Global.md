## MOTION CLARITY

### Ultimate 120 Hz / 0.2 ms for exceptional motion clarity

The new premium ASUS OLED display with 120 Hz refresh rate and 0.2 ms pixel response time is incredibly smooth and clear. In fact, both surprisingly and counter-intuitively, the 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display is faster than a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD IPS display — because it reduces ghosting to an indiscernible level. Simply put, this means even fast-moving visuals are smoother and clearer than ever.

## MOTION CLARITY

### How 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display has better motion clarity than 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display

It seems counter-intuitive that a 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display could outperform a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display rival — so how is this possible? Well, the LCD panel takes precisely 6.06 ms to refresh each frame, but it takes another 3 ms of response time to process the correct colors. That’s a total of 9.06 ms to fully load the image. A 144 Hz / 12.5 ms LCD display takes even longer, at 19.44 ms to show the full, final frame of each image. But with its extreme-speed response, a 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display takes just 8.5 ms to process the same — making it even faster than a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display.

## ASUS SPLENDID TECHNOLOGY

### Customizable color gamut for every need

The display’s color gamut can be quickly and easily switched for different tasks or preferences. On top of the ultravivid native color setting, choose sRGB for creating web content or browsing, DCI-P3 for cinema content, or Display P3 for movie-grade colors finessed to fit everyday viewing in the real world.
