## Color

### Ultimate professional-grade colors

ASUS OLED laptops deliver exceptionally detailed and realistic visuals, with a cinema-grade 100% DCI-P3 color gamut. This means that the colors reproduced on the display are richer and more vivid: it’s ideal for color-intensive projects, but also enhances any kind of content.

Cinema-grade

industry standard

LCD100% sRGBOLED100% DCI - P3

ASUS OLED laptops maintain a 100% DCI-P3 color gamut at both high and low brightness levels, while on a standard LCD laptop the color gamut is reduced dramatically at low brightness levels. At a gray-level brightness of 16 G, LCD laptops only have an 11% DCI-P3 color gamut, while ASUS OLED laptops maintain a 100% DCI-P3 color gamut.

## Eye Care

### 70% blue-light reduction for eye care

Blue light is known to cause visual discomfort and disrupt sleep quality. However, due to the nature of the special organic lighting materials in an OLED display, ASUS OLED laptops emit 70% less harmful blue light<sup class="footnote-num">2</sup>, and they’re also certified by TÜV Rheinland and SGS. More importantly, unlike traditional blue-light filters, shifting the spectrum means there’s no need to compromise color accuracy.

Harmful blue light wavelengthOLED Exposure (6.5%)LCD Exposure (21.5%)OLED with less harmful blue light

## Eye Care

### Eye care, even more critical for children

Since children’s eyes are not fully developed, with a more transparent lens and cornea, harmful blue light can penetrate the eye more easily, potentially causing premature aging of the retina. Research<sup class="footnote-num">5</sup> has shown that in a five-year-old child’s eyes, approximately 60% of the received blue-light emissions pass through to the retina, compared to only around 20% for a 60-year-old adult. With ASUS OLED displays, the significantly lower blue light levels mean better eye care for children.

## Perceptual Brightness

### OLED has much higher perceptual brightness

On conventional LCD displays, detail and color quality usually decrease dramatically as the brightness is reduced. But ASUS OLED laptops are able to show great detail at lower brightness settings due to their high contrast and their ability to maintain a wide color gamut at low brightness. ASUS OLED laptops can maintain good color reproduction at any brightness level, so you can freely adjust the screen’s brightness to suit your working environment, while still enjoying exceptionally vivid colors. For example, in the living room environment (usually illuminated at about 100 lux), you only need 177 nits brightness in an OLED display to produce the same clear image as 400 nits brightness in an LCD display. At the lower brightness levels needed on OLED displays, there’s less harmful blue light emitted.

\* Required brightness on OLED to reproduce same colors on 400 nits LCD screens.

## Contrast

### True black: See the unseen

ASUS OLED laptops reproduce blacks perfectly. An OLED pixel consists of three sub-pixels, each with its own self-generated illumination: a 4K (3840 x 2400) display has 9,216,000 pixels, which means it has 27,648,000 self-illuminated sub-pixels, compared to just a few dozen LED backlights in most LCD displays. When displaying black on an OLED display, the pixel is simply turned off to produce the darkest possible black. This enables extremely crisp and clear images even in the darkest scenes. You’ll be surprised to see how many new details you’ll spot in your favorite movies!

## Response Time

### Fastest response time on any laptop for motion clarity

For a display, response time is the time taken to replace one color with another: the faster the time, the better motion is reproduced. The diagram below shows a color transition from purple to blue. On an ASUS OLED, this transition takes only 0.2 milliseconds, while on an LCD, it might take 10 ms or longer. This makes a lot of difference, since OLED colors and images look correct for most of the time a frame is displayed, whereas LCD images may be blurry during the transition process.

ASUS OLED displays have a 0.2 ms response time – the fastest of any laptop, and 50x faster<sup class="footnote-num">7</sup> than the average laptop LCD display. This ensures smoother fast-paced action scenes, low-latency gameplay, and subtle details like blur-free text scrolling. In effect, the smooth visuals on an OLED display can rival those on an LCD display with a much higher refresh rate.

### Colors for the future

Creativity never sleeps, so we’ve designed Vivobook Pro 16X OLED to be neutral yet contemporary — it matches any style, any time. 0˚ Black is a pure black color with anodized aluminum texture and a straightforward feel, encouraging you to follow your instincts. Meteor White features our futuristic textured coating on the metal lid, which creates a subtle vibe that’s designed to express the true you. This sleek and tactile high-tech coating looks like fine suede, but has a solid and practical feel that's remarkably resistant to fingerprints and smudges. It's created using a 3-stage process on the bare aluminum alloy, starting with a primer coat for a strong bond, followed by a colored base coat. It's finished off with the special textured coating, which contains tiny, soft particles that create the lush suede-like appearance. It's an amazing finish, for an amazing laptop.
