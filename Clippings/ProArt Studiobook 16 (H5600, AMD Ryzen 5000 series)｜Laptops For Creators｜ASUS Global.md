## GPU

### Fast graphics, stable drivers

Fast 3D graphics processing power is provided by up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 GPU, which is based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, NVIDIA’s second-generation of RTX technology. Whether you’re working on complex 3D scenes, high resolution video, or high-quality livestreaming, ProArt Studiobook 16 is more than equal to the task thanks to the advanced features in the GPU including ray tracing and AI acceleration and fast GDDR6 memory, along with the ability to increase GPU power from 80 W to 110 W, adjusting the system fan speed as needed for optimum performance. For outstanding driver stability, we use NVIDIA Studio Drivers to ensure maximum performance, rock-solid reliability, and wide software compatibility.

## Thermal

### It’s cool to be quiet

Keeping a powerhouse like ProArt Studiobook 16 cool is vital for top performance, but unwanted noise is the enemy of creativity. We’ve designed the ASUS IceCool Pro cooling system to let the mighty AMD CPU run comfortably at a blistering 135 watts total TDP (45 W CPU and 90 W GPU) in Performance mode — with no throttling. This remarkable feat of engineering uses dual 102-aerofoil blade fans, the world’s first to use over 100 blades<sup class="footnote-num">3</sup>. The slim aerofoil blades are made from side-chain liquid crystal epoxy polymer (SCP): the quiet, power-efficient 3D-curved design increases airflow by 16%<sup class="footnote-num">4</sup>. Six heat pipes and seven intelligent sensors ensure optimum cooling performance, while keeping everything quiet — under 40 dBA in Normal mode — so you can concentrate on the task at hand without distractions. In addition, ProArt Studiobook 16 features NVIDIA’s AI-powered WhisperMode 2.0, which gives you even more control over the laptop’s fans so you can balance performance and acoustics.
