## What is the Obsidian Hub?

Welcome! This is an experimental vault that is maintained by the Obsidian community.

For best results we recommend [downloading this vault](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub/releases/latest) locally and opening it in Obsidian or browsing it in our [publish site](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub).

This vault was inspired by the [awesome-obsidian](https://github.com/kmaasrud/awesome-obsidian) list.

We think of this vault as a [Digital garden](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/05+-+Concepts/Digital+garden). This means that the content in our vault is very much a work in progress. Since we're at a very early stage, there's a lot of space to grow! You can check out a few sample notes here:
