## Business-focused design

With features such as a user-status indicator light, AI-powered noise cancelation and AI-powered camera, the ExpertBook B5 is designed to make every moment of every working day more convenient and more productive. Not to mention its durability is also tested to the extreme, so the ExpertBook B5 is ready for the business world.

To level up professional conferencing, ExpertBook B5 has two-way AI noise-canceling technology that employs sophisticated machine learning to isolate unwanted noise. The technology not only filters out ambient noises picked up around you, allows you to deliver a clear speech, but is also able to filter out ambient noises coming from the speaker — so you can hear clearly. A step up from the original technology, you are able to specify the directions of the sound reception when enabling the microphone, which allows the ExpertBook B5 to focus on the presenter, regardless of the location. This will result in even cleaner voice delivery.
