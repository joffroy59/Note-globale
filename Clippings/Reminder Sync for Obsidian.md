## Reminder Sync for Obsidian User Manual

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Reminder Sync is designed to be used with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the [Tasks Plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction) configured to use the [Emoji task format](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/Tasks+Emoji+Format).

Additionally Reminder Sync works with any notes application that stores notes as Markdown files and represents tasks as a list item beginning with a checkbox. Note that metadata extraction would still require the [emoji task format](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/Tasks+Emoji+Format) from Obsidian, even if using an alternative notes app.

#### Installing Reminder Sync

Install Reminder Sync for Obsidian from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reminder-sync-for-obsidian/id6478323460?mt=12).

On first launch, follow the setup wizard to configure access to Reminders, your Vault Directory and the Reminder List you would like to use.

Once you have granted Reminders access, configured your Vault Location, and selected a Reminder list, click Next to continue setup.

To begin syncing your tasks turn on the Enable Syncing toggle:

#### Reminder Sync Inbox

When you create a Reminder in the synced list with Reminders.app a Task will be created in the root of your Obsidian Vault in a note named 'Reminder Sync Inbox.md'.

The name and location of the inbox note can be configured in the settings menu: click the inbox name to set a new location.

#### Configuration Options

| --- | --- |
| Sync Frequency | How often your Obsidian Vault is checked for Tasks. |
| Enable Syncing | Turn on to Sync your Tasks at the selected Sync Frequency. |
| Allow Deletes | Controls behaviour when deleting a Reminder from your Synced list: if enabled when a Reminder is deleted the synced Task is also deleted from your Vault. |
| Skip Kanban | If using with the Kanban Plugin, enable to exclude Kanban notes from syncs. |
| Global Task Filter | Enable to set a global task filter for which Tasks are synced to Reminders. |
| Add Completion Date | If enabled the completion date will be added to the source Task when completing a synced Reminder. |
| Filter Text | The filter text used by the Global Task Filter. E.g. if set to #task only Tasks containing the text #task will be synced to Reminders. |
| Due Tasks Only | If enabled, only Tasks from your Obsidian Vault with a due date component are synced to your Reminders. |
