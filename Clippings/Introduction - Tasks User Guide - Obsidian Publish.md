## Task management for the Obsidian knowledge base

Track tasks across your entire [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. Query them and mark them as done wherever you want. Supports due dates, recurring tasks (repetition), done dates, sub-set of checklist items, and filtering.

You can toggle the task status in any view or query and it will update the source file.

## Screenshots

- *All screenshots assume the global filter `#task` which is not set by default (see also "Getting Started").*
- *The theme is default Obsidian theme.*
