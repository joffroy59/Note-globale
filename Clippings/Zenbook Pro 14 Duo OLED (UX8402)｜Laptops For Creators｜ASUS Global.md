## MUX SWITCH

### MUX switch for reduced latency

If you’re creating gaming content, Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED has a clear advantage with its MUX switch. The GPU sends graphics frames directly to the display without passing through the CPU, a strategy that reduces latency and boosts the refresh rate.

## THERMAL TECHNOLOGY

### Best cooling system with AAS Ultra and IceCool Plus

All these powerful components need to be cooled effectively in order to reach their full potential. This starts with the ASUS IceCool Plus cooling system, which uses two quiet IceBlades fans with up to 97 3D-curved blades. These cool the two 8 mm heat pipes from the CPU and GPU, and 38% more hot air is vented to the exterior via the increased 20 mm lift of the new AAS Ultra mechanism. The result is that the CPU and GPU can run at up to an 85 W combined TDP, without throttling!
