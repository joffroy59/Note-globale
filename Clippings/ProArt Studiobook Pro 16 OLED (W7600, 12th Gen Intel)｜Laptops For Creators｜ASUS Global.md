## PERFORMANCE

### Performance for professionals

ProArt Studiobook Pro 16 OLED was designed with one goal in mind: to give you all the raw performance you need to handle even the toughest, most resource-hungry projects. It’s equipped with up to a mighty Intel Core i9 processor, professional-grade NVIDIA RTX A3000 12 GB graphics, one of the world’s fastest SSDs, and has a flexible memory configuration with up to a massive 64 GB of high-speed RAM. It’s the ultimate professional laptop, built for the ultimate professional.

## CPU

### Fire up your imagination

ProArt Studiobook Pro 16 OLED is powered by up to a 12th Generation Intel Core i9-12900H processor that makes light work of super-complex, heavily multithreaded, photorealistic rendering, visualization, simulation or analysis applications. This 14-core processor gives you a mobile workstation with professional performance, easily outperforming mainstream models to make your creative workflow effortless. For the ultimate performance, you can enable Performance mode, which automatically increases the CPU power limit value from 45 to 75 W sustained, or 95 W temporarily, and adjusts the fan speed setting to keep the processor cool enough for maximum performance.

## GPU

### Fast graphics, stable drivers

Professional-level 3D graphics processing power is provided by an NVIDIA RTX A3000 12 GB Laptop GPU, which is based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, NVIDIA’s second generation of RTX technology. It blitzes through the toughest tasks, such as complex CAD models, 3D product design, or high-resolution video editing, thanks to the advanced features in the GPU, including ray tracing and AI acceleration and fast GDDR6 video memory, along with the ability to increase GPU power from 80 W to 115 W, adjusting the system fan speed as needed for optimum performance. For outstanding driver stability, we use NVIDIA Studio Drivers to ensure maximum performance, rock-solid reliability, and wide software compatibility.

## Thermal

### It’s cool to be quiet

Keeping a powerhouse like ProArt Studiobook Pro 16 OLED cool is vital for top performance, but unwanted noise is the enemy of creativity. We’ve designed the ASUS IceCool Pro cooling system to let the mighty Intel CPU run comfortably at a blistering 140 watts total TDP (50 W CPU and 90 W GPU) in Performance mode — with no throttling. This remarkable feat of engineering uses dual 102-aerofoil blade fans, the world’s first to use over 100 blades<sup class="footnote-num">3</sup>. The slim aerofoil blades are made from side-chain liquid crystal epoxy polymer (SCP): the quiet, power-efficient 3D-curved design increases airflow by 16%<sup class="footnote-num">4</sup>. The precision-applied liquid metal on the CPU cooler maximizes heat dissipation, enabling a 29% package power improvement. Six heat pipes and seven intelligent sensors ensure optimum cooling performance, while keeping everything quiet — under 40 dBA in Standard mode — so you can concentrate on the task at hand without distractions. In addition, ProArt Studiobook Pro 16 OLED features NVIDIA’s AI-powered WhisperMode 2.0, which gives you even more control over the laptop’s fans so you can balance performance and acoustics.

## Motion Clarity

### Ultimate 120 Hz / 0.2 ms for exceptional motion clarity

The new premium ASUS OLED display with 120 Hz refresh rate and 0.2 ms pixel response time is incredibly smooth and clear. In fact, both surprisingly and counter-intuitively, the 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display is faster than a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD IPS display — because it reduces ghosting to an indiscernible level. Simply put, this means even fast-moving visuals are smoother and clearer than ever.

## Motion Clarity

### How 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display has better motion clarity than 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display

It seems counter-intuitive that a 120 Hz / 3 ms OLED display could outperform a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display rival — so how is this possible? Well, the LCD panel takes precisely 6.06 ms to refresh each frame, but it takes another 3 ms of response time to process the correct colors. That’s a total of 9.06 ms to fully load the image. A 144 Hz / 12.5 ms LCD display takes even longer, at 19.44 ms to show the full, final frame of each image. But with its extreme-speed response, a 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display takes just 8.5 ms to process the same — making it even faster than a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display.
