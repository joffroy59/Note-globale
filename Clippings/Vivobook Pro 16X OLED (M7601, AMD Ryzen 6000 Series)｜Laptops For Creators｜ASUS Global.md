## MOTION CLARITY

### Ultimate 120 Hz / 0.2 ms for exceptional motion clarity

The new premium ASUS OLED display with 120 Hz refresh rate and 0.2 ms pixel response time is incredibly smooth and clear. In fact, both surprisingly and counter-intuitively, the 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display is faster than a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD IPS display — because it reduces ghosting to an indiscernible level. Simply put, this means even fast-moving visuals are smoother and clearer than ever.

## MOTION CLARITY

### How 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display has better motion clarity than 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display

It seems counter-intuitive that a 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display could outperform a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display rival — so how is this possible? Well, the LCD panel takes precisely 6.06 ms to refresh each frame, but it takes another 3 ms of response time to process the correct colors. That’s a total of 9.06 ms to fully load the image. A 144 Hz / 12.5 ms LCD display takes even longer, at 19.44 ms to show the full, final frame of each image. But with its extreme-speed response, a 120 Hz / 0.2 ms OLED display takes just 8.5 ms to process the same — making it even faster than a 165 Hz / 3 ms LCD display.

## NOISE CANCELATION + 3 MIC![](https://www.asus.com/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)

### Next-level ASUS AI Noise-Canceling Technology

With the increase in remote working and video conferences, we’ve strengthen the ASUS AI Noise-Canceling Technology with built-in 3-array microphones to further enhance 360<sup class="sign-deg">°</sup> sound reception. The AI noise canceling technology employs machine learning thereby isolating unwanted noise from human speech.

Through using the MyASUS app, users can switch between the Microphone Single-Presenter mode, which can filter out ambient noise, to the Multi-Presenter mode which pick up all individual voices from different positions for optimum group conference-call quality. In addition, the AI Noise-Canceling Speaker feature filters out all ambient noise apart from human speech — so you’ll hear what everyone else is saying. Try the demo to experience the amazing difference that AI Noise-Canceling Technology can make in different environments.
