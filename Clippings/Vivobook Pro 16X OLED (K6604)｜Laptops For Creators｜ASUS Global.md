## THERMAL

### IceCool technology for an ultracool laptop

Creating without disturbances is essential for content creation. Keeping all these powerful components quiet requires a solid cooling system. Vivobook Pro 16X OLED features ASUS IceCool Pro thermal technology, ensuring that both the Intel Core CPU and NVIDIA GPU run comfortably at their combined 150 W thermal design power in Performance mode. To achieve this, the dual 83-blade liquid-crystal epoxy-polymer fan blades are just 0.15 mm thin, increasing airflow by up to 6%<sup class="footnote-num"><a href="https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-creators/vivobook/vivobook-pro-16x-oled-k6604/#footnote-14" aria-label="Footnote 14">14</a></sup>. We’ve also introduced a new dual cooling fin design to increase heat transfer. This design provides a larger cooling area, ensuring more heat is transferred effortlessly from heat pipes to fins. The fins have a shark fin-inspired design, increasing the turbulence of the air in the heating layer to ensure efficient heat exhaust. In addition, Vivobook Pro 16X OLED features three fan modes, easily switched in MyASUS, empowering you to choose the balance between acoustics and performance.
