# Getting Started with Docker: Understanding the Basics üíª

Welcome to our guide on Docker! In this article, we will discuss the basics of Docker including its installation, containerization, and how it can help you manage your applications more effectively.

## What is Docker? ‚ò∏Ô∏è

Docker is an open-source platform for building, shipping, and running distributed applications. It utilizes [Containerisation Technology](containerization) to package an application and its dependencies into a container, which can run consistently on any host system without the need to modify the code or configure the machine.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Before we dive into how Docker simplifies your application management, let's see how you can install it:

1. Verify if [Ubuntu](ubuntu) or [MacOS](macos) is already in use or install one of the mentioned operating systems. For Windows users, download and install [Windows Server Core](windows-server-core).
2. Download the latest version of Docker from its [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
3. Install the application following the provided instructions based on your operating system.
4. Once installed, verify the installation using the command line:

```bash
$ docker --version
```

## Docker Containers üê≥

Now that we have our installation up and running, let's have a closer look into containers:

- **Container**: a lightweight, portable, isolated environment to run your applications. It contains everything necessary for the application such as libraries, runtime, etc., with a minimal footprint (100MB or less).
- **Container image**: a file containing all the necessary elements to create a container. They can be stored at Docker Hub ‚Äì a cloud repository of container images which you can share or pull from.

## Conclusion üèÅ

Docker simplifies application management by offering consistency, portability, and scalability across environments without changing codes. With efficient use of resources and the ability to easily share applications via container images, Docker has become a popular tool for developers worldwide.

Once you have familiarized yourself with the basics of Docker, you can venture into more complex topics such as [Docker Networking](docker-networking), [Multi-container Applications](multi-container-applications), and [Orchestration with Kubernetes](kubernetes-orchestration).

Happy Containerizing! üê≥üöÄ
