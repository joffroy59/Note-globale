**ai**: 1. The note titled [[Test Url trouvée]] contains a link to an article on how to connect ComfyUI to Open WebUI for a self-hosted private OpenAI instance. The article can be found at this URL: [Connect ComfyUI to Open WebUI for Your Own Self Hosted Private OpenAI](https://noted.lol/connect-comfyui-to-open-webui/)

2. In the same note, there is an image titled avec Lechat which seems to be related to the article but its content is not clear from the provided context.

3. Another note titled [[Open WebUI avec ComfyUI]] mentions two other notes: [[Faire fonctionner Open WebUI avec ComfyUI (Stability Matrix)]] and [[Test Url trouvée]]. This suggests that there might be more information about ComfyUI in the note titled [[Faire fonctionner Open WebUI avec ComfyUI (Stability Matrix)]].

4. There is also a note titled [[Vérification du bon fonctionnement pour Open WebUI - ComfyUI]] which seems to be related to testing the functionality of Open WebUI with ComfyUI, but it doesn't provide any direct information about ComfyUI.

5. To summarize, the important details about 'comfyui' from your notes can be found in the article linked in [[Test Url trouvée]] and possibly in the note titled [[Faire fonctionner Open WebUI avec ComfyUI (Stability Matrix)]]. However, the content of these notes needs to be reviewed for more specific information.
