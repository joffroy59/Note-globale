**user**: how many daily note 
[Timestamp: 2025/02/26 08:31:19]

**ai**:  To answer your question, the number of daily notes you should create depends on your personal preference and workflow. In the provided information, it seems that there are three types of daily notes mentioned: task management, periodic notes for projects management, and journal sections.

   For task management, a new daily note is created each day to manage tasks. For projects management, periodic notes are created for weeks, months, quarters, and years. The journal section is also part of the daily and periodic notes.

   If you want to focus on task management, you should create a new daily note every day. If you prefer to manage your projects on a weekly or monthly basis, you can create a new note for each week or month accordingly.

   It's essential to find a workflow that suits your needs and helps you stay organized and productive. You can experiment with different approaches to see what works best for you.

**user**: liste not for ccivitai 
[Timestamp: 2025/02/26 08:31:59]

**ai**:  Based on the provided context, I cannot find any direct relation between the given notes and the term "ccivitai". However, I can suggest some possible steps to find relevant notes:

1. First, let's focus on the task management notes. In your vault, you have a note titled [[Liste Task Idea status Daily Note]] which includes tasks related to daily notes. You might want to check if there are any tasks related to "ccivitai" in this note.

2. Secondly, there's another note titled [[Planing Task List in Daily Note]], where you mention using templates for planning tasks within #dailynotes. If you have a template or a task list related to "ccivitai", it might be stored here.

3. Lastly, there is also a note titled [[Liste Task Idea Daily Note]] which seems to be filtering tasks related to daily notes and ideas. You may want to check if there are any tasks or ideas related to "ccivitai" in this note.

If you don't find anything relevant in these notes, I would recommend searching your entire vault for notes containing the term "ccivitai". To do so, you can use the following query:

````tasks
content includes "ccivitai"
````

This will return all notes containing the term "ccivitai".

[Timestamp: 2025/02/26 08:33:00]

**ai**:  Based on the context provided, I have searched for notes related to "civitai" in your Obsidian vault. Here are the relevant notes I found:

1. [[Liste Task Idea status Daily Note]] - This note contains a query for tasks that include the tag #idea and are located within the Daily Note folder, but it does not explicitly mention "civitai". However, you might find related information if you search this note for the term "civitai".

2. [[Planing Task List in Daily Note]] - This note mentions a template called [[Templates/Poub/Planning Tasks]], but it does not explicitly mention "civitai". Again, you might find related information if you search this note for the term "civitai".

3. [[Liste Task Idea Daily Note]] - This note contains a query similar to the first one, but it does not explicitly mention "civitai". You might find related information if you search this note for the term "civitai".

Since I could not find any notes with the exact term "civitai", I recommend checking these notes and searching your entire vault using the query:
````tasks
content includes "civitai"
````
This will help you locate any notes that contain the term "civitai".
