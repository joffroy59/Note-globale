## Filters

### Custom Filters.
- [x] https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Filters #toview âœ… 2025-01-14

#### Text property examplesÂ 

##### task.description.length > 150
```tasks
filter by function task.description.length > 150
```
##### LikeÂ `due date is invalid`
```tasks
filter by function const date = task.due.moment; return date ? !date.isValid() : false;

```
##### all tasks due today or earlier
```tasks
filter by function task.due.moment?.isSameOrBefore(moment(), 'day') || false
```
##### Due today or later
```tasks
filter by function task.due.moment?.isSameOrAfter(moment(), 'day') || false
```
##### all tasks due in the week of 2025-01-11
```tasks
filter by function task.due.moment?.isSame(moment('2025-01-12'), 'week') || false
```

#### File property examples - date
##### Find tasks in files in any file in the given folderÂ **only**, and not any sub-folders:  Daily Note/2025/01/"
```tasks
filter by function task.file.folder === "Daily Note/2025/01/"
```
##### Find tasks in files in a specific folderÂ **and any sub-folders**:  Daily Note/2025/"
```tasks
filter by function task.file.folder.includes("Daily Note/2025/")
```

##### - Find tasks in files in the folder that contains the query only (**not tasks in any sub-folders**).
```tasks
filter by function task.file.folder === query.file.folder
```


### Searching particular datesÂ 

This section describes searches that use single dates, for example:

```tasks
starts before 2023-04-20
due on or before today
```


See alsoÂ [Searching date ranges](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters#Searching%20date%20ranges).


#### priority is high
```tasks
priority is high
```
#### priority is low
```tasks
priority is low
```


### Searching date rangesÂ 

Released

Date range searches were introduced in Tasks 2.0.0.

Tasks allows date searches to specify a pair of dates,Â `<date range>`.

This section describes date range searches, for example:


```tasks
due 2025-01-01 2023-02-15
```


See alsoÂ [Searching particular dates](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters#Searching%20particular%20dates).

## Text filters


```tasks
(no due date) OR (due after 2021-04-04)
path includes OBSIDIAN
```

```tasks
due after 2021-04-04
(path includes a) AND NOT (tags include #todo)
```

## Filters for Task Statuses
### Status
#### Same as theÂ `done`Â filter, but might be useful in conjunction with other expressions on the same line.
```tasks
filter by function task.isDone
```

- Same as theÂ `done`Â filter, but might be useful in conjunction with other expressions on the same line.

```tasks
filter by function ! task.isDone
```




### Status Name
#### Find all tasks with custom statuses not yet added to the Tasks settings.
```tasks
filter by function task.status.name === 'Unknown'
```

#### Find tasks of typeÂ `NON_TASK`
```tasks
filter by function 'TODO,IN_PROGRESS'.includes(task.status.type)
```

#### Find tasks that are either typeÂ `TODO`Â or typeÂ `IN_PROGRESS`.
```tasks
filter by function 'TODO,IN_PROGRESS'.includes(task.status.type)
```
#### Find tasks that are not typeÂ `NON_TASK`Â and not typeÂ `CANCELLED`.
```tasks
filter by function ! 'NON_TASK,CANCELLED'.includes(task.status.type)
```


### Status Symbol
#### Find tasks with a checkboxÂ `[-]`, which is conventionally used to mean "cancelled"
```tasks
filter by function task.status.symbol === '-'
```
#### Find tasks with anything but the space character as their status symbol, that is, without the checkboxÂ `[ ]`
```tasks
filter by function task.status.symbol !== ' '
```

#### Find tasks with any status symbol not supported by Tasks in the default settings
```tasks
filter by function !' -x/'.includes(task.status.symbol)
```

### Next Status Symbol
#### - Find tasks that toggle to themselves, because the next symbol is the same as the current symbol
```tasks
filter by function task.status.symbol === task.status.nextSymbol
```


## Filters for Task Dependencies
### Blocking Tasks

## Filters for Other Task Properties
### Description

### Tags
- `no tags`
- `has tags`
- `tags (include|do not include) <tag>`Â _or_
- `tag (includes|does not include) <tag>`
    - Matches case-insensitive (disregards capitalization).
    - Disregards the global filter when matching.
    - TheÂ `#`Â is optional on the tag soÂ `#home`Â andÂ `home`Â will work to matchÂ `#home`.
    - If theÂ `#`Â is given, it must be present, so searching forÂ `#home`Â will matchÂ `#home`Â but notÂ `#location/home`.
    - The match is partial soÂ `tags include foo`Â will matchÂ `#foo/bar`Â andÂ `#foo-bar`.
- `tags (regex matches|regex does not match) /<JavaScript-style Regex>/`Â _or_
- `tag (regex matches|regex does not match) /<JavaScript-style Regex>/`
    - Does regular expression match (case-sensitive by default).
    - Essential reading:Â [Regular Expression Searches](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Regular+Expressions).
    - This enables tag searches that avoid sub-tags, by putting aÂ `$`Â character at the end of the regular expression. See examples below.
    - If searching for sub-tags, remember to escape the slashes in regular expressions:Â `\/`
Since Tasks 4.2.0,Â **[custom filtering](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Custom+Filters)Â by tags**Â is now possible, usingÂ `task.tags`.

#### Find tasks with exactly 1 tag (other than any global filter)
```tasks
filter by function task.tags.length === 1
```

#### Find tasks with more than one tag (other than any global filter)
```tasks
filter by function task.tags.length > 1
```

#### Find all tasks that have at least one nested tag
```tasks
filter by function task.tags.find( (tag) => tag.includes('/') ) && true || false
```
#### Find all tasks that have at least one doubly-nested tag, such asÂ `#context/home/ground-floor`
```tasks
filter by function task.tags.find( (tag) => tag.split('/').length >= 3 ) && true || false
```

#### Tag Query ExamplesÂ 

- `tags include #todo`
- `tags do not include #todo`
- `tag regex matches /#t$/`
    - Searches for a single-character tagÂ `#t`, with no sub-tags, becauseÂ `$`Â matches the end of the tag text.
- `tag regex matches /#book$/i`
    - The trailingÂ `i`Â means case-insensitive.
    - Searches for tags such asÂ `#book`,Â `#Book`,Â `#BOOK`Â and theÂ `$`Â prevents matching ofÂ `#books`,Â `#book/literature`, etc.
##### done
```tasks
tags include #done  
```

##### todo
```tasks
tags include #todo   
```





##### tasks
```tasks
tag regex matches /#*a/i 
```










##### tasks
```tasks
tags include #task 
```



##### Find tasks in files in the root of the vault
```tasks
filter by function task.file.root === 'Daily Note/2025/01/'
```


### HeadingÂ 

- `heading (includes|does not include) <string>`
    - Whether or not the heading preceding the task includes the given string.
    - Always tries to match the closest heading above the task, regardless of heading level.
    - `does not include`Â will match a task that does not have a preceding heading in its file.
    - Matches case-insensitive (disregards capitalization).
- `heading (regex matches|regex does not match) /<JavaScript-style Regex>/`
    - Whether or not the heading preceding the task includes the given regular expression (case-sensitive by default).
    - Always tries to match the closest heading above the task, regardless of heading level.
    - `regex does not match`Â will match a task that does not have a preceding heading in its file.
    - Essential reading:Â [Regular Expression Searches](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Regular+Expressions).
