 # Getting Started with Docker in Obsidian

Docker is a powerful tool for containerizing applications, making development, testing, and deployment more efficient. In this guide, we will learn how to get started with Docker using Obsidian as our knowledge management system.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of Docker concepts such as containers, images, and volunteers.
- An installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) engine on your machine.
- A [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) editor for managing notes.

## Setting Up Obsidian for Docker Notes

To set up Obsidian to help manage our Docker knowledge, we will create some useful aliases and tags:

1. Create a new folder called "Docker" in your Obsidian vault to contain all of the notes related to Docker concepts and usage.
2. In the Docker folder, create a new file named "Docker Basics" or any other meaningful alias you prefer for an overview of Docker concepts. Use tags such as `#Docker`, `#Containers`, and `#Images`.

```markdown
- [[Docker]]
	+ [[Docker Basics|Intro to DockerConcepts]] (#Docker #Containers #Images)
	+ ...
```

3. Whenever you create new notes related to the 'Docker' topic, ensure they are nested under this folder and use relevant tags.

4. Over time, as you learn more about Docker in your Obsidian workspace, links between related notes will help make connections between different concepts quickly.

## Summary

In this article, we have learned how to get started with using Obsidian to manage our knowledge about Docker effectively. By creating a dedicated folder for all things Docker and applying tags for easy navigation, it becomes a breeze to keep track of your learnings when working with Docker containers on your projects.

In future tutorials, we will dive deeper into topics such as using Docker in development workflows, creating custom Docker images, network settings, and more.
